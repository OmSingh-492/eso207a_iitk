My Programs in the course ESO207A, 2022-23-II

I took the ESO207A course (Data Structures and Algorithms) under Prof. Sanjeev Saxena at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur in the 2022-23-II semester.
It had a lab component in it as well. We were allowed to use only C language for solving the problems in the labs.
Here, I have tried to update all the solutions which I had submitted against the problems which were originally asked in the labs.

Hope this shall be helpful to other students taking this course under him [which I would strongly recommend. He taught the course extremly well].

P.S.: It would be great if you find out some errors in the code anywhere. Create pull requests. This is still a work in progress, and some inadvertent 
errors might have crept in.
Thanks!
